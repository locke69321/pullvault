# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
`Security` tab → `Advisories` → `Report a vulnerability`.

If you cannot use that workflow, contact the maintainers by another private channel (please avoid public issues for security reports).

## Scope
In scope:
- PullVault source code and official release artifacts.

Out of scope:
- Third-party dependencies (please report to their maintainers first).
- Self-hosted deployments with local modifications.

## Supported Versions
Only the default branch (`main`) and the latest release (when available) receive security fixes.

## Disclosure
We practice coordinated disclosure. Please allow a reasonable time for investigation and fixes before any public disclosure.
