# PullVault

PullVault is a comic collection, automation, and management app. It helps you build a library, monitor series and story arcs, and automatically find missing and new issues.

**Status**  
Early development (pre-alpha). Features and behavior will change.

**What It Does**
- Track your comic library and reading lists.
- Monitor series and story arcs for new issues via metadata providers.
- Watch indexers/trackers for missing issues.
- Integrate with torrent clients, Usenet clients, and AirDC++ to acquire monitored comics.
- Convert archives (CBR, CBZ) to CBZ when desired.
- Embed metadata and rename files when desired.

**Planned Workflow**
- Add series or story arc lists to your library.
- PullVault monitors metadata providers for new issues.
- It searches configured sources for missing/new issues.
- Acquired files are normalized, tagged, and organized.
